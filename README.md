# About
This repository is a practice playground for building 100+ small projects using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. Each project is self-contained in its own folder so you can iterate, learn, and demo frequently.

Use it to:

* Build muscle memory with DOM, layout systems, animations, responsive design.
* Practice progressive enhancement and accessibility.
* Prepare a portfolio of small, focused demos.

## Goals & Learning Outcomes
* HTML: semantic structure, accessibility (ARIA), forms, multimedia.
* CSS: layout (Flexbox, Grid), responsive patterns, transitions, animations, BEM or utility patterns.
* JavaScript: DOM manipulation, events, fetch/XHR, simple state management, localStorage, ES modules.
* Tooling: Git, deployment (GitHub Pages / Netlify), simple automated checks (linting).
* Soft skills: documenting projects, writing clear READMEs, incremental commits.
